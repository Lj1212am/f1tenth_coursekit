Grading Rubrics
==================

Labs & Final Project
------------------------
Grading rubrics for all 8 labs and the final projects can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbbqYJ3zdfNtegcT-3L4uwd-yt-gWFyf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116660630717436430566&rtpof=true&sd=true>`_. You will want to download a copy of this rubric to edit.

Note that these rubrics are available to the students at the beginning of each lab so the expectations are transparent.

Races
--------
The grading rubic for all three races can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gvkIyaZuPUC6-Cb7FpFiT8ZrpwOfUKHX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116660630717436430566&rtpof=true&sd=true>`_.

Race 1 and Race 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Total Points Possible: 100

	* **80 points** if the team can complete 3 or more consecutive laps without crashing
	* **(N/L) x 10 points**  where **N** is the number of consecutive laps the team can complete with crashing
	* **(X/T) x 10 points** where **T** is the fastest lap time in seconds

| Set **L** to be the number of consecutives laps to achieve an "A" grade.
| Set **X** to be the fastest time in seconds to achieve an "A" grade.

Note that the time intervals will need to be adjusted to your specific track.

For example, for the Levine Loop at the University of Pennsylvania, **L = 7** and **X = 16**. A team completes 5 consecutive lap with a best lap time of 23.48 seconds. Their grade would be:
	
	* 80 points for completing 3 laps 
	* :math:`+` (5/7)*10 points for completing 7 consecutive laps
	* :math:`+` (16/23.48)*10 points for best lap time
	* = 80 + 7.14 + 6.81 = 93.95 points
